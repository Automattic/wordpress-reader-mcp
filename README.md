## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Usage

### Background Authentication Service

WordPress Reader runs a background authentication service that handles token management automatically. This service needs to run constantly for seamless authentication.

**Service Management Commands:**
```bash
# Check service status
npm run service:status

# Start service
npm run service:start

# Stop service
npm run service:stop

# Restart service
npm run service:restart

# View service logs
npm run service:logs

# Check service health
npm run service:health
```

**Automatic Service Management:**
- The setup script automatically starts the service
- The MCP server will try to start the service if it's not running
- Service runs in the background and persists across reboots (with optional system integration)

**Manual Service Management:**
```bash
# Development mode (with auto-reload)
cd web-app && npm run dev

# Production mode (background service)
npm run service:start
```

**System Integration (Optional):**
To start the service automatically on system boot:
```bash
# Install as system service
node service-manager.js install

# macOS: Enable with launchctl
# Linux: Enable with systemctl --user
```

### Viewing Logs

MCP server logs are in: `mcp-server/mcp-server.log`

### Environment Variables

You can set these in your shell:
- `DEBUG=true` - Enable debug logging
- `NODE_ENV=development` - Development mode

## üîí Security & Privacy

- Your WordPress.com credentials are stored locally only
- Authentication tokens are cached securely
- No data is sent to third parties
- All communication is encrypted (HTTPS/TLS)
- **Confidentiality Protection**: Automatically checks for the `p2_confidentiality_disabled` sticker on WordPress.com blogs; only allows AI access to blogs with this sticker
  - Set `DISABLE_CONFIDENTIALITY_CHECK=true` in the MCP server environment to disable this protection (not recommended)

## üìû Support

If you need help:

1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Look for error messages in the terminal
3. Check the MCP server logs
4. Ensure your WordPress.com app is configured correctly
